# So a player starting in 1947 will be considered to start at year "0" and a player starting
# in 1957 will be considered to start at year "10".

}

# Four seems to be the best fit for the data. 
# 
# There is an odd shear in the data in YS as it relates to present day players because
# they are being counted, but their careers are not complete. This creates an anomaly. 
# 
# More modern players have a population of players with larger BMIs. 
# 
# Players who started later have a better chance at a longer career
# 
# The kmeans data seems to suggest that there are fewer players with 14+ year careers
# with a high BMI. 
# 
# And lastly, it looks like early players, as a group, were not as tall as the players who
# came after them. 

#Thanks for looking!
